# CodeQL Advanced Setup
# This workflow overrides GitHub's Default Setup to explicitly control which
# languages are scanned, preventing false warnings about undetected languages.
#
# To enable scanning for additional languages:
#   1. Uncomment the desired language in the 'language' matrix below.
#   2. Ensure source files of that language exist in the repository.
