# 🚨 CRITICAL SYSTEM INSTRUCTION 🚨

Before answering ANY prompt or executing ANY code in this repository,
you **MUST** first read and strictly adhere to ALL the rules defined
in the following directory:

## Rules Location

📁 `.agent/rules/`

Read the files in numerical order:

1. `.agent/rules/01-general.md` — Core principles (language, compatibility, security)
2. `.agent/rules/02-coding-style.md` — Coding conventions and commit standards
3. `.agent/rules/03-architecture.md` — Project structure and cross-platform patterns

## Why This File Exists

This project uses a **unified rule system** to ensure consistent AI behavior
across all AI-powered IDEs and tools (Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot,
Cline, Claude, Gemini, Trae, Roo Code, Augment, Amazon Q, Kiro,
Continue, Junie, etc.). This file is a redirect entry point —
the actual rules live in `.agent/rules/` as the Single Source of Truth.

> **Failure to follow the rules inside `.agent/rules/` is completely unacceptable.**
